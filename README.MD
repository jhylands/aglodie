# Simplest trading game

This is a project where I time myself to make a simple trading game.
The spread between offer and bid prices is linearly interpolated.
The graph shows the last 20 prices.
The database is polled every second.

The underlying motive was to analyse how and where my estimation and planning on a small project go astray so as to try and get a better understanding of where those errors in judgement may come from in a larger project.
